# My Task

My Task

This was my very first challenge with HTML and CSS, being the very first homework assignment in my Coding Bootcamp. 
I was given a starter code that needed to improve and make accessible. In other words, I had to refactor it, without changing what it does.

Among many of my changes, here is a list of some of overarching changes I have achieved: 

- I have restyled both HTML and CSS to reflect proper coding semantics
- I have restructured code for easier readablity
- I have groupped together repetative elements
- I have fixed links and image locations
- I have modified the title to reflect the company's information
- I have added helpful comments and documentation
- Last, but not least, I have updated all image tags with web accessibility standards.

Being the very first homeworkd project in my Coding Bootcamp, this assignent did present some challenges, but the work was certainly rewarding.
